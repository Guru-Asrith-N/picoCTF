started reading the primer initially whose link is sent in readme

#### caas

opened caas challenge    
opened the web version of shell provided by picoCTF   
created a temporary directory after logging in using `mkdir /tmp/1`   
entered the directory using `cd /tmp/1`   
downloaded the index provided in caas challenge in the webshell using `wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/picoMini+by+redpwn/Web+Exploitation/caas/index.js`   
downloaded a file called "index.js"   
used `file index.js`. It is a file with ASCII text   
used `cat index.js`   
used this link " cowsay as a service" to open the challenge in a new tab   
opened source code of the file    
entered the link "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}" in a seperate tab. It showed a cow saying "{message}"   
went back to the source code of "cowsay as a service ". Noticed a line which had `<code></code> ` but was blank inside   
got stuck here for a while because i didn't know what to enter   
after going through the indexes and writeups found that you are supposed to enter "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}" and replace '(message}' with what you want to enter    
replaced '{message}' with 'hi' and tried it. The cow in starts to say 'hi' instead of 'message'    
tried using `ls` command . didn't work    
tried using 'hi;ls' it showed a series of text along with hi    
found one series of text named 'falg.txt'    
tried using `hi;ls;falg.txt`     
got the flag

#### forbidden paths 
 
opened forbidden paths challenge     
since the challenge is saying that absolute paths are bening filtered then that means relative paths should be used     
searched in google for how to change absolute paths to relative paths     
found a blog pertaining to the problem     
entered /../share/nginx/html/flag.txt . Didn't work   
entered /../../../../flag.txt . Didn't work    
entered ../../../../../flag.txt    
got the flag

#### local authority

opened local authority challenge   
opened page source    
checked everything     
used inspect to check everything once     
got stuck for a while    
saw a writeup     
started searching all the other links in the source code   
searched 'style.css' . Nothing was there     
searched 'login.php'. Took me to another page which had 3 more links to search 'style.css', 'admin.php' , ''
