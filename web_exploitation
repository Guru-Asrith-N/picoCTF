### writeup on web exploitation

started reading the primer initially whose link is sent in readme

#### caas

opened caas challenge
opened the web version of shell provided by picoCTF
created a temporary directory after logging in using `mkdir /tmp/1`
entered the directory using `cd /tmp/1`
downloaded the index provided in caas challenge in the webshell using `wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/picoMini+by+redpwn/Web+Exploitation/caas/index.js`
downloaded a file called "index.js"
used `file index.js`. It is a file with ASCII text
used `cat index.js`
used this link " cowsay as a service" to open the challenge in a new tab
opened source code of the file 
entered the link "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}" in a seperate tab. It showed a cow saying "{message}"
went back to the source code of "cowsay as a service ". Noticed a line which had `<code></code> ` but was blank inside
got stuck here for a while because i didn't know what to enter
after going through the indexes and writeups found that you are supposed to enter "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}" and replace '(message}' with what you want to enter
replaced '{message}' with 'hi' and tried it. The cow in starts to say 'hi' instead of 'message'
tried using `ls` command . didn't work
tried using 'hi;ls' it showed a series of text along with hi
found one series of text named 'falg.txt'
tried using `hi;ls;falg.txt` 
got the flag
