### writeup on binary_exploitation

#### stonks

opened the challenge in ubuntu   
opened 1 terminal . downloaded vuln.c file using `wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/17ba7f9351aca192c45833c658742fe5/vuln.c`   
tried running it using `./a.out` . Entered the value 1 for buying stocks . Didn't work     
Entered 2 for viewing portfolio . Didn't work   
opened the c program using `nano vuln.c` . noticed that API key comes under buying stonks but it didn't work     
opened another terminal for connecting using nc command `nc mercury.picoctf.net 27912`     
entered 1 for buying stocks . It worked because it asked for entering API key     
entered multiple values and none of them worked     
finally referred to some writeups . they said that you have to search for pointer data    
used `%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p` as %p represents pointer type data    
got value in hexadecimal format '0x88414f00x804b0000x80489c30xf7fb7d800xffffffff0x10x883f1600xf7fc51100xf7fb7dc7(nil)0x88401800x10x88414d00x88414f00x6f6369700x7b4654430x306c5f490x345f74350x6d5f6c6c0x306d5f790x5f79336e0x326663310x306131300xffd1007d'      
tried using both first part and second part in hexadecimal converter. the second part after (nil) has a flag     
got this '7¹Socip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n2fc10a10ÿ½}' after convering hexadecimal to ASCII in 'https://neapay.com/online-tools/hex-to-ascii-converter.html'      
filtered all the unreadable data     
got this 'ocip  {FTC  0l_I  4_t5  m_ll  0m_y  _y3n  2fc1  0a10}'     
the flag is there but it seems to have each 4 digits reversed(since we took it as hexadecimal hence each 4 digits are reversed)      
after reversing everything manually got the flag    
```
flag : picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_1cf201a0}
```


#### babygame01

opened the challenge  
since nc command is given opened 2 terminals   
in one terminal downloaded the game    
in the other terminal wrote the `nc` code given    
took some time to undersatnd the game mechanics      
understood that w,a,s,d work as the arrow keys for up,left,down and right    
won the game but no flag was given          
saw how up, down , left and right i could go      
checked a writeup after nothing else worked      
saw that you are supposed to go 4 spaces back from starting point although didn't understand     
moved 4 spaces and got the flag number as 64       
when tried to reach the end of game with it , it became 46     
after reaching end flag was given       
```
flag : picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_8985ce0e}
```


#### buffer overflow 0

opened the challenge     
downloaded program and source using `wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/173/vuln` and `wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/173/vuln.c`   
opened another terminal     
used `nc saturn.picoctf.net 55984`    
entered input andd it sent me out    
in first terminal used `file vuln.c.1`    
used `cat vuln.c.1`     
didn't understand so referred writeup 'https://programmingfire.com/picoctf-2022-binary-exploitation-buffer-overflow-0'     
it is a segmentation fault as shown in the picture in readme       
after searching in google foe segmentation fault found multiple causes for it    
after going through the code found gets command . used man gets . found that it discards what is already there and adds the new input hence not a good function    
using gets command we can cause a 'buffer overflow' which will cause the flag to be given outside      
got the flag       
```
flag : picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d} 
```
