### writeup on binary_exploitation

#### stonks

opened the challenge in ubuntu   
opened 1 terminal . downloaded vuln.c file using `wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/17ba7f9351aca192c45833c658742fe5/vuln.c`   
tried running it using `./a.out` . Entered the value 1 for buying stocks . Didn't work     
Entered 2 for viewing portfolio . Didn't work   
opened the c program using `nano vuln.c` . noticed that API key comes under buying stonks but it didn't work     
opened another terminal for connecting using nc command `nc mercury.picoctf.net 27912`     
entered 1 for buying stocks . It worked because it asked for entering API key     
entered multiple values and none of them worked     
finally referred to some writeups . they said that you have to search for pointer data    
used `%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p` as %p represents pointer type data    
got value in hexadecimal format '0x88414f00x804b0000x80489c30xf7fb7d800xffffffff0x10x883f1600xf7fc51100xf7fb7dc7(nil)0x88401800x10x88414d00x88414f00x6f6369700x7b4654430x306c5f490x345f74350x6d5f6c6c0x306d5f790x5f79336e0x326663310x306131300xffd1007d'      
tried using both first part and second part in hexadecimal converter. the second part after (nil) has a flag     
got this '7¹Socip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n2fc10a10ÿ½}' after convering hexadecimal to ASCII in 'https://neapay.com/online-tools/hex-to-ascii-converter.html'      
filtered all the unreadable data     
got this 'ocip  {FTC  0l_I  4_t5  m_ll  0m_y  _y3n  2fc1  0a10}'     
the flag is there but it seems to have each 4 digits reversed(since we took it as hexadecimal hence each 4 digits are reversed)      
after reversing everything manually got the flag    
```
flag : picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_1cf201a0}
```
